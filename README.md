# REPL driven development with hot-loading of Libraries
A simple web application server that is created using REPL driven development and hot-loading of libraries using `clojure.tools.deps.alpha`

> NOTE: `clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl/add-libs` design is not finalized and may change at any time without notice.  If hot-loading stops working, check the [GitHub project](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha) for changes.

* [Project Repository](https://github.com/practicalli/hot-loading)


## Usage
Start a REPL using the :alpha/hotload-libs alias from [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/install/community-tools.html) user-level configuration

With Rebel Readline Terminal REPL UI with nREPL support:
```shell
clojure -M:alpha/hotload-libs:repl/rebel-nrepl
```

Or with Clojure nREPL editor support for Cider, Calva, Conjure, etc.
```shell
clojure -M:alpha/hotload-libs:middleware/cider-clj
```
